## 🛒 Zubee – MERN Stack E-commerce Website

Zubee is a full-featured, full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Designed to replicate the core functionality of a modern online store, Zubee offers a seamless user experience from browsing products to completing secure payments.

This project was developed to strengthen my skills in full-stack web development, API design, secure data handling, and real-world integration of third-party services. It includes key e-commerce features such as:

🛒 Product listing, filtering, and search

👤 User authentication and role-based authorization (Admin/User)

🧺 Cart and order management

💳 Payment gateway integration (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe) for secure transactions

📦 Admin dashboard for product, order, and user management

🌐 Fully responsive UI with intuitive navigation and a clean design

The application follows a modular, scalable architecture and emphasizes code reusability, state management, and performance optimization across both frontend and backend layers.

Zubee reflects my capability to build production-ready full-stack applications that combine technical functionality with user-centric design.
